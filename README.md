## Implementation
### Task runner || Gulp
I have written a gulpfile to compile the scss to css and minify them as well. Also, used browser sync to listen for any changes to the files for reload.
### Javascript
* I added some vanilla javascript to open and close the nav bar when we are in smaller screen device. 
* Also added some JS for the nav bar to be sticky and slowly transition for better user experience.
### Issue with some font
As some font like IvyPresto Display was not available, I had to use some other font that was similar. 

## To Run the project

In the project root directory you can run 

### `npm install`

After installing all the node packages you need to run 

### `gulp`
