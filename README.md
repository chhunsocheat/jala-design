## Implementation
### Hosted in AWS
* This is the IP address to the live site: 3.23.129.255
* You can login to wordpress using username: admin, password: password
### Converted this site into Wordpress theme
* I have converted this static site into a wordpress theme and have included the them file in this directory. 
* I have also used Advanced Custom Feilds so that the content of the site can be manage by logging into the wordpress admin. 
* I have recorded a short demo to short the responsiveness of the site and also how I integrated wordpress and how user can change the content of the site with wordpress.
* Here is the link to the short demo:

### Task runner || Gulp
I have written a gulpfile to compile the scss to css and minify them as well. Also, used browser sync to listen for any changes to the files for reload.
### Javascript
* I added some vanilla javascript to open and close the nav bar when we are in smaller screen device. 
* Also added some JS for the nav bar to be sticky and slowly transition for better user experience.
### Issue with some font
As some font like IvyPresto Display was not available, I had to use some other font that was similar. 

## To Run the project

In the project root directory you can run 

### `npm install`

After installing all the node packages you need to run 

### `gulp`

Hope you like my implementation of this design.
